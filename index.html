                <p>Agile is supposed to make our processes and collaboration efforts more efficient. So why does it feel like it’s holding us back?</p>
                <p>Agile is now more than 20 years old. It’s a development process, not a design process.</p>
                <p>UX has never been a consideration in implementing Agile processes. Nothing is mentioned about delivering great experiences in the original Agile Values or Manifesto documents. Agile was always about making development more efficient.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, conventional thinking about Agile doesn’t help us with this. Agile was not conceived with UX in mind — we’re on our own to make this work.</p>
                <p>It’s time to <strong>Take control of Agile UX</strong>.</p>
                <p>The way we’re working has matured. Our developers are now ready to iterate quickly and work more flexibly. Product sees research as more and more valuable. Project management now includes UX into deeper levels of strategic thinking. </p>
                <p><em>Yet we’re still treating Agile the same.</em></p>
                <p>We must adapt our Agile process to not hold us back. We need an Agile UX process that delivers innovative designs to our customers and users.</p>
                <p>It’s time to take what we’ve learned over the past 20 years and piece together a modern, redesigned approach to Agile UX.</p>

                        We must change our approach to Agile and to UX to have the impact we want.

                    <p>
                        Much of what holds us back is outdated thinking about UX and Agile. We’re stuck in 2001 when Agile was conceived, and today’s UX practices were in their infancy. We’ve learned so much in the last two decades. We know how to do better.
                    </p>

                    <p>Agile and UX <strong>can</strong> work together. To do that, we need to reframe some misconceptions about how we put them together. We need to replace old, dysfunctional habits with state-of-the-art techniques and processes. </p>

                    <p>
                        The 'definition of done' is at the center of successful Agile implementations.’ This definition is an agreement amongst team members as to when they should stop working on one piece and move on to others. The definition of done is where UX leaders can strongly influence what the teams deliver as products and services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For Agile and UX to successfully work together, the definition of done must have the users’ needs with all their subtlety and nuance baked in. We must infuse the definition of done with extensive user research to drive a more human-centered product development process.

                    <p>
                        Agile only succeeds when teams work autonomously. In every sprint, an Agile team faces dozens (if not hundreds) of critical decisions affecting the users’ eventual experience. We will never have enough UX team members in the room to make all of those critical decisions. How do we ensure every Agile team member makes high-quality design decisions?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We must increase each Agile team member’s UX skills and responsibilities. Our UX leaders must shift from thinking it’s their responsibility to make those UX decisions. Instead we can lead every team into making smart decisions that result in substantially improved products and services.
